## Overview
The SenseCAP Indicator integrates dual-core MCUs ESP32-S3 and RP2040. This tutorial focuses on creating projects using the ESP32-S3 with ESP-IDF.

There are two simple project creation methods: GitHub Template and Squareline Studio.

## Project Creation Methods

### 1. GitHub Template
#### Step 1: Create a New Project
- Visit the [SenseCAP Indicator Template repository](https://github.com/Seeed-Solution/indicator-esp-idf-template) and click `Use this template` to start a new repository.

#### Step 2: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/indicator-esp-idf-template.git
```

#### Step 3: Build the Project
Navigate to the project directory and build the project:
```bash
cd indicator-esp-idf-template
idf.py build
```

#### Step 4: Flash the Project
Connect the device via USB and flash the project using:
```bash
idf.py -p PORT flash
```

#### Step 5: Monitor the Project
Monitor the output with:
```bash
idf.py -p PORT monitor
```
*Note: Replace `PORT` with your device's port number.*
